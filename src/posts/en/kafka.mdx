Imagine the following scenario: you are an e-commerce developer handling thousands of orders per hour. That means orchestrating order events, payments, inventory updates, and notifications. **Messaging** truly shines in this kind of scenario, where many events arrive in real time and multiple systems need to process them asynchronously.

In environments with many sensors, such as smart farms, factories, or networks of medical equipment, IoT devices continuously send measurements, allowing other devices to react to that data.

Example: a sensor measures humidity, temperature, and light at a specific point in a plantation, sends this information to a message broker (such as Kafka), and from there the irrigation service reads the soil moisture data and decides whether it needs to turn on the sprinklers in that location.

## Messaging

Messaging is a way for multiple systems to exchange information without one service directly calling another. They communicate by sending and receiving messages through an intermediary, such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.

Messaging helps solve several common problems in modern systems:

* **Decoupling services:** ensures that microservices communicate without creating tight coupling.
* **Asynchronous task processing:** operations can run in the background without blocking the user.
* **Distributing work across multiple consumers.**
* **Improving system resilience:** if a service goes down, messages are retained and will be processed when it comes back up.

## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source messaging system that stores data streams in a durable, ordered, and distributed manner. With it, you can build systems that collect logs, track user activity, and integrate multiple components in a resilient way.

This is precisely where Kafka stands apart from most others. In many traditional brokers—such as RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and SQS—the message typically disappears after a consumer reads it and acknowledges processing.

### Advantages

* Handles a high volume of messages.
* Real-time processing.
* Fault tolerance and durability.
* Data retention, making it ideal for multiple consumers.

### Disadvantages

* Overkill for low data volumes (less than 1,000 messages per second).
* Configuration and operational complexity.
* High maintenance and specialist costs.
* Steep learning curve.

For smaller workloads or simpler messaging patterns, tools like RabbitMQ or even cloud-based queues may be more practical.
